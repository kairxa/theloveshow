## The Love Show

is a stupid entertainment idea from [RiXtopia](https://www.facebook.com/RiXtopia?fref=ts) to make some kind of
chat show. You know, talk show, but via chatting. Stupid, yes?

Well, here's the client version.

Theme is taken directly from [Discord](www.discordapp.com), kudos to them for making such a great chat app.

### What to do

Enter this into the input box and press enter. See what happens.

```
z: Test
```

`z: [message]` for Zlaxxar,  
`k: [message]` for Kairxa,  
`e: [message]` for Elrix.

### Tools used

Playing around with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is used to bind them all.

Basically this repo is used for me to play around with Typescript. A nice superset of Javascript there.
Kudos to Microsoft.
